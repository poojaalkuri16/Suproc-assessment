## 📖 About the Project

Suproc AI Business Agent is an explainable AI procurement assistant that understands procurement requirements expressed in natural language and executes a transparent multi-stage reasoning pipeline to identify suitable procurement entities from local datasets.

Unlike a traditional chatbot, the system performs structured reasoning through requirement extraction, planning, search, validation, recommendation generation, outreach drafting, and human approval before any external action.

</p>

| Stage | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Requirement Extraction | Convert natural language into structured requirements |
| Planning | Generate execution strategy |
| Search | Retrieve matching entities from local datasets |
| Constraint Filtering | Apply procurement constraints |
| Ranking | Score candidate entities |
| Validation | Verify recommendation quality |
| Retry Evaluation | Handle validation failures |
| Recommendation | Produce ranked recommendations |
| Outreach Draft | Prepare procurement enquiry drafts |
| Human Approval | Wait for user approval before external actions |

# 🛡 Validation & Reliability

The agent incorporates multiple mechanisms to improve reliability and explainability throughout execution.

- ✅ Natural language requirement extraction
- ✅ Deterministic fallback when LLM extraction fails
- ✅ Constraint filtering before recommendation
- ✅ Recommendation validation
- ✅ Retry evaluation for unsuccessful searches
- ✅ Human approval before external actions
- ✅ Complete execution logs for transparency

# 📈 Engineering Highlights

### Explainable AI

Every stage of the agent pipeline exposes its reasoning, intermediate outputs, execution status, and runtime.

### Grounded Recommendations

Recommendations are generated using structured local procurement datasets rather than free-form LLM responses.

### Human-in-the-Loop

The system never performs external actions automatically. Outreach drafts require explicit user approval.

### Modular Architecture

Each stage of the pipeline is implemented as an independent engine, making the system maintainable and extensible.

### Local Execution

The complete application—including the AI model—runs locally using Ollama and FastAPI without requiring external AI services.
